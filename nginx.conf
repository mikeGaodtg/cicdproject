# =============================================================================
# NGINX CONFIGURATION FOR REACT APPLICATION
# =============================================================================
# This configuration file is used by nginx to serve the React application
# It handles routing, caching, and static file serving
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# SERVER BLOCK CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Define a server block that handles incoming HTTP requests
server {
    # =============================================================================
    # LISTEN DIRECTIVE
    # =============================================================================
    # Listen for incoming connections on port 81
    # This port matches the EXPOSE directive in the Dockerfile
    listen 81;
    
    # =============================================================================
    # DOCUMENT ROOT AND INDEX
    # =============================================================================
    # Set the root directory where nginx will look for files to serve
    # This points to the directory where the React build files are located
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    
    # Set the default index file to serve when accessing the root URL
    # This is the main entry point of the React application
    index index.html;

    # =============================================================================
    # REACT ROUTING HANDLING
    # =============================================================================
    # Handle all requests to the application
    # This location block is crucial for React Router to work properly
    location / {
        # Try to serve the requested file, then try with trailing slash,
        # and finally fall back to index.html for client-side routing
        # This allows React Router to handle navigation on the client side
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # =============================================================================
    # STATIC ASSETS CACHING
    # =============================================================================
    # Configure caching for static assets (CSS, JS, images)
    # This improves performance by reducing server load and speeding up page loads
    location /static/ {
        # Set cache expiration to 1 year for static assets
        # This is safe because React build files include content hashes in filenames
        expires 1y;
        
        # Add cache control headers
        # "public" allows caching by browsers and CDNs
        # "no-transform" prevents modification of the cached content
        add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
    }
